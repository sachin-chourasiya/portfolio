# ðŸ“§ Email Setup Guide for Contact Form

Your contact form is now configured to send emails to `sachinchourasiya.c.123@gmail.com` when someone submits the form. Follow these steps to set up email functionality.

## ðŸ”§ Gmail Setup (Free)

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to "Security"
3. Enable "2-Step Verification" if not already enabled

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. In Google Account settings, go to "Security"
2. Under "2-Step Verification", click "App passwords"
3. Select "Mail" and "Other (custom name)"
4. Enter "Portfolio Contact Form" as the name
5. Click "Generate"
6. **Copy the 16-character password** (you'll need this)

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables in Netlify

After deploying to Netlify:

1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to "Site settings" > "Environment variables"
3. Add these variables:

```
EMAIL_USER = sachinchourasiya.c.123@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS = [your-16-character-app-password]
```

**Important:** Use the App Password, NOT your regular Gmail password!

## ðŸš€ How It Works

When someone fills out your contact form:

1. âœ… Form data is validated
